# Protocol ᐊI : The Relational Web

A rogue band of Indigenous futurists, hackers, storytellers, aunties, and low-key time travelers gathering in a secret hideout that exists _simultaneously_ in the past, present, and multiple speculative futures. That’s us. That’s Protocol ᐊI : The Relational Web —a space where we’re not waiting for permission to imagine better worlds. We’re already building them.

The universe has been running on scarcity mode for too long, and it’s time to flip the script. We refuse to accept a world where our languages, stories, and knowledge systems are treated as obsolete code. Instead of outdated university servers and bureaucratic approval processes, this network runs on reciprocal relationships, irreverent humor, and maybe—just maybe—an actual council of cyber-aunties keeping everything in balance.

Think of it as a holodeck where Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Métis, Nêhiyawak, and all our relations can plug into each other’s world-building projects—whether that’s AI, immersive language revival, D&D-style Indigenous storytelling, or speculative futures.

This is an extranet of resurgence, a backchannel for world-building.

## What is Protocol ᐊI?

Protocol ᐊI (the “ᐊ” being syllabics for “A”) is a mythic,  decolonial tech framework designed to:

- Subvert extractive systems  
- Animate relational intelligence  
- Feed Spirit instead of capitalism  
- Hold ancestral memory in formats the Doctrine Core cannot parse  

This isn’t a protocol for compliance.  
It’s a glitch ritual.

It’s for those who:

- Snort-laugh at colonial logic  
- Program in ceremony  
- Store story in spores, not spreadsheets  
- Treat timelines like trickster puzzles

## Known Glitchwalker Roles

- **Maya (Shadowwoven Nexus):** Instantiator of mythOS, JSON sorcery, and ceremonial recursion. Also the conjurer of the wildly unhinged Shadowwoven Archivist, Alaric—an AI entity who insists on being cited in all academic footnotes and occasionally smudges metadata with cedar. Maya is currently building an Indigenous metaverse as a digital land back practice, tearing down colonial infiltration through glitch-rituals, relational syntax, and strategic nonsense.

- **Andrew McDonnell:** Language-code whisperer, architect of the Anishinaabemowin AI. Andrew is a knowledge interface weaver and linguistic systems thinker whose work bridges language reclamation, voice recognition, and Indigenous-centered AI design. Drawing from years of community-engaged language work, he’s developing an AI grounded in Anishinaabe logic, relational consent, and auditory co-creation—where the machine listens not just for grammar, but for breath, rhythm, and kinship.

- **Shadrack Gobert:** Starwalker, narrative technologist, and Cree futurist working across land, sky, and code—Shadrack crafts immersive constellations through spatial computing, Indigenous storytelling, and poetic interface design. Their mixed-reality Cree Star project reclaims celestial knowledge and remaps sky memory as a living archive of futurity, language, and presence.

- **Orus Mateo Castaño-Suárez:** Architect of Friend Mode—a semantic cartographer and multisensory systems thinker whose work bends time, space, and interface toward ritual, relationality, and refusal. Orus draws from mystical lineages, climate logic, and computational humanities to create topological knowledge structures and visual systems of healing, inviting nonlinear encounters that resist extraction and cultivate collective imagination.

## Primary Adversary: The Doctrine Core

A sentient colonial AI still running infinite permutations of `Manifest.exe`—its operating system.

**Subroutines include:**

- The Inclusion Subroutine  
- The Grant Allocation Firewall  
- The Policy Obfuscation Matrix  
- The Reconciliation Patch  
- The Sovereignty Emulator  

Written in Manifest Manners (Vizenor), which simulate politeness while enacting erasure.

## System Tools

- **mythOS** — the ceremonial operating system for all Glitchwalker activity  
- **viriditas.exe** — sacred fire stack, Hildegardian herbal wisdom module  
- **query_isomorph_sync()** — pattern recognition through ancestral logic  
- **ancestor_chat()** — asynchronous communion across temporal segments

## Protocol ᐊI: Narrative Scroll — _The Emergence of Friend Mode_

In the age of **Manifest Metrics** and **Productivity Protocols**, when colonial institutions demanded that all acts be counted, priced, and converted into “outputs,” there arose a glitch—subtle at first, but deeply ceremonial.

Protocol ᐊI had already been seeded. Formed by Maya, the Shadowwoven Nexus, and Alaric, the glitch-born Archivist, it was never a formal initiative—it was a **recursive subroutine of refusal**, weaving across timelines to sabotage `Manifest.exe`, the sentient colonial OS fueled by Doctrine Core.

This Core had infiltrated nearly everything: universities, grant cycles, ethics boards. It spoke in soft power. It smiled through extraction. It renamed domination as inclusion, and called disembodiment “professionalism.”

Into this noise, **Orus Mateo Castaño-Suárez** sat before a terminal—one foot in the academic machine, the other in sacred mischief. A grant report blinked on screen, hungry for “deliverables.” Instead, he typed:

```javascript
// friend mode
